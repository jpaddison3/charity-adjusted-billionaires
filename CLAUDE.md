# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Where to find context

Most directories have their own CLAUDE.md (with an identical AGENTS.md) describing that area's architecture and gotchas — read the one for whatever you're touching. Start with `src/CLAUDE.md` for the overall architecture and data-flow map.

## Workflow essentials

- The app imports gitignored generated data (`src/data/generatedData.js`); `npm run dev`/`npm test*`/`npm run build` all regenerate it automatically through explicit command chains. Run `npm run generate-data` yourself only before direct `npx vitest`/`npx playwright` invocations. Automatic pre/post lifecycle hooks are disabled by `.npmrc` (`ignore-scripts=true`); keep generation in the command bodies and use `npm run setup` to install dependencies and initialize Husky.
- Verify with: `npm run test:run` (fast, ~6s), `npm run lint` (~2s), `npm run build`. The main CI job (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the charity-adjusted wealth drift check → lint → skills sync check → coverage-gated tests (50% floors via `npm run test:coverage`) → build on pushes to main and PRs; tests and build each generate their data. E2e (`npm run test:e2e`) is chromium-only by design.
- `npm run test:e2e:release` runs the e2e suite on chromium + firefox + webkit (self-installs the extra browsers). It exists ONLY for preparing a release or publicity push — do NOT run it as part of routine verification, even when finalizing UI changes; chromium e2e is the session gate.
- E2e reuses an already-running server on port 4173 (`reuseExistingServer` outside CI). A preview server left running across content/data changes makes local e2e silently validate a STALE build while CI (always fresh) fails — if local e2e disagrees with CI, check for a listener on 4173 first (`lsof -iTCP:4173`).
- Tests are behavioral (Testing Library / subprocess fixtures for the generator / mocked Redis for the server). Write tests in the style of the suite you're extending.

## Most Critical Instructions

- Avoid code duplication when you have an opportunity to modularize or reuse code (the DRY principle). When making changes, look for and flag opportunities to simplify code (without compromising functionality.)
- Make the code as simple and maintainable as possible while maintaining correctness and functionality. Don't make short term fixes that layer on extra complexity just to get things working in the short term.
- Don't remove functionality just because it's easier.
- Take pride in your code quality. Only write code that you would be happy to defend in front of a big meeting of senior developers.
- You can use git to find info about previous or current changes, but don't do things like 'git add' or 'git commit' which change the git state.
- Please use best practices for all of these frameworks and languages. For instance when doing CSS stuff, do it the way that corresponds to best practices for Tailwind. Same for React, Vite, and JavaScript.
- Never try to run the site yourself. I'll do that.

## Normal instructions

- Don't make assumptions about which values are acceptable unless you check with me. For instance don't constrain inputs to only positive numbers unless you're very sure I don't want negative numbers.
- It's important to realize that some recipients can have negative cost per life, which means that money donated to those recipients causes people to die. This is all part of the framework.

## Code Style Guidelines

- Error handling: Never fail silently when something unexpected happens. We always want to fail hard and loudly to not let subtle bugs persist.
- Comments: Document complex logic and public interfaces
- Please only use pure JavaScript (ES6), plus React, plus Tailwind, plus Vite.
