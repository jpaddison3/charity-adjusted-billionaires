# Repository Guidelines

- Ignore this file if you're Claude Code, it's for another coding agent

## Project Structure & Module Organization

- Source: `src/` (components, pages, utils, hooks, contexts). Data generated to `src/data/generatedData.js`.
- Content: `content/` (categories, donors, recipients, donations, `globalParameters.md`).
- Scripts: `scripts/` (e.g., `generate-data-from-markdown.js`).
- Static: `public/`, entry `index.html`.
- Most directories contain an AGENTS.md (identical to the sibling CLAUDE.md) with that area's architecture and gotchas — read it before working there. `src/AGENTS.md` has the overall data-flow map.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `npm run generate-data`: Build `src/data/generatedData.js` from `content/`. `npm run dev`/`npm test*`/`npm run build` run it automatically through explicit command chains; run it manually only before direct `npx vitest`/`npx playwright` invocations. Automatic pre/post lifecycle hooks are disabled by `.npmrc` (`ignore-scripts=true`); keep generation in the command bodies and use `npm run setup` to install dependencies and initialize Husky.
- `npm run dev`: Start Vite dev server.
- `npm run build`: Generate data, then production build via Vite.
- `npm run preview`: Serve the built app locally.
- `npm test` / `npm run test:run`: Vitest (watch / single run). `npm run test:coverage` enforces 50% coverage floors.
- `npm run test:e2e`: Playwright, chromium only (builds production first). `npm run test:e2e:release` adds firefox + webkit — release-prep only, never routine verification.
- E2e reuses an already-running server on port 4173 outside CI (`reuseExistingServer`). A preview server left running across content/data changes makes local e2e silently validate a stale build while CI (always fresh) fails — if local e2e disagrees with CI, check for a listener with `lsof -iTCP:4173` first.
- `npm run lint` / `npm run lint:fix`: Lint (and auto-fix) JS/JSX.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- Formatting: Prettier (2-space indent, 120 char width, single quotes). Config in `.prettierrc`.
- Linting: ESLint with React, Hooks, and Prettier plugins (`eslint.config.js`). Pre-commit `lint-staged` blocks warnings (`--max-warnings=0`); GitHub Actions CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs lint, coverage-gated tests, and the build on pushes/PRs.
- Components: Named arrow functions in PascalCase files, e.g. `src/components/RecipientList.jsx`.
- Utilities: camelCase files, e.g. `src/utils/effectsCalculation.js`.
- Hooks: `useX` naming in `src/hooks/`, e.g. `useAssumptionsForm.js`.
- Avoid DRY violations. If logic, data shaping, configuration, UI state, handlers, markup patterns, or constants are repeated or nearly repeated across files or features, extract a shared utility, hook, component, or constant unless there is a clear reason not to.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

- Commits: Imperative, concise messages (e.g., “fix combined cost per life”). Group related changes.
- Pre-commit: Husky + `lint-staged` runs ESLint on staged JS/JSX with `--max-warnings=0`.
- PRs: Include description, linked issues, and rationale. For UI changes, add screenshots or short clips. Note any data changes and run `npm run generate-data` before screenshots.
- Do not commit `src/data/generatedData.js` (it’s generated and gitignored).

## Data & Configuration Tips

- Edit `content/**` markdown and `content/globalParameters.md`; then run `npm run generate-data`.
- Validate generation output; the script performs integrity checks and will fail fast on missing links.
